# Machine Learning in Python
This repository includes all data files I used to learn Machine Learning in Python.

## iris.csv
The iris data set is one of the most famous data set and classifier example. It even has its own [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) page! An iris is a flower, made up of sepals and petals. There are three types of irises in the data set: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. We can see four characteristics: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## winequality-red.csv
The data file records characteristics and quality rankings of Portuguese wine from the [Wine Quality Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
